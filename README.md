# So Far
When I started this project I was refreshing in Javascript after not using it for a few years
and I always draw up a 'game of life' in new languages/paradigms
as a method to help me learn the syntax and get used to stuff. Since then, I've updated it significantly with new
features and better logic.

# Since the initial commit:
I've added many features: dynamic resizing of the canvas is based on the device/window size. Cells can be 
resized to 4 different values, the speed (in generations/per second) can be altered, the colors
can be selected, and you can click on cells individually to turn them on/off to design your own 
starting patterns.
