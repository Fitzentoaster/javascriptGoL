Simple Game of Life from a new Javascript learner

# So Far
I'm new to Javascript, and I always draw up a 'game of life' in new languages/paradigms
as a method to help me learn the syntax and get used to stuff. So far it just randomizes
the board and applies the rules to generate an animation that can be stopped/started
at will. 

# To Do
I want to work with mouseclick events to let you draw initial states/edit the current state,
as well as alter the speed of animation and colors and other fun stuff. As of 
this writing (3/7/2023) the program is brand new.
