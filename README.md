# So Far
I'm new to Javascript, and I always draw up a 'game of life' in new languages/paradigms
as a method to help me learn the syntax and get used to stuff. So far it just randomizes
the board and applies the rules to generate an animation that can be stopped/started
at will. 

# Since the initial commit:
I've added many features: dynamic resizing of the canvas is based on the device/window size. Cells can be 
resized to 4 different values, the speed (in generations/per second) can be altered, the colors
can be selected, and you can click on cells individually to turn them on/off to design your own 
starting patterns.

# To Do
Improve the actual algorithms to be less naive and perform faster, though they perform significantly fast enough 
to get the job done at the current level.
